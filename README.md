# Creating a contract in aave protocol

This project creates a contract using aave protocol. The contract used to deposit any ERC20 token to earn intrest or keep that as collateral to deposit any other ERC20 token and repaying the amount we took.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
